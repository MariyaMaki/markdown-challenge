  #### You can always count on me whenever you need someone to hear you out.
  I will bring my energy and my empathy! :kissing_heart:
  ##### A funny story
  I injured my ankle on a mountain, had to go all the way down alone, met a dead foal (he was eaten by something) and when I arrived down the guides told me there was a bear up there and they didn't tell before so we can have a nice stroll...
  ###### TL;DR
  Guides want people dead :joy:
